Beech trees (Fagus sylvatica) dominate the scene, their leaves tinged with a pale yellow-brown hue, showing early signs of climate stress. Spruce trees (Picea abies) stand sparsely, with signs of wilting and dry branches. In the distance, young walnut trees (Juglans regia) and ginkgo trees (Ginkgo biloba) start to appear, symbolizing an ecological shift. The ground is dry but still fertile, with autumnal hues and scattered grass. Natural light filters through a slightly hazy sky, suggesting warmer temperatures.'
